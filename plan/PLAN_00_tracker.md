# PLAN 00 - Molecule Hypothesis Elimination Tracker

Status: ACTIVE
Progress: [#########-] 90%
Scope: Track hypothesis-elimination plans, dependencies, blockers, and readiness.
Acceptance: Active plans are current; completed plans are marked DONE; blocker status reflects `check_axioms`.
Dependencies: PLAN_11, PLAN_12, PLAN_15, PLAN_17, PLAN_18, PLAN_20, PLAN_21, PLAN_22, PLAN_23, PLAN_24, PLAN_25, PLAN_26, PLAN_27, PLAN_28, PLAN_29, PLAN_30, PLAN_31, PLAN_32, PLAN_33, PLAN_34, PLAN_35, PLAN_36, PLAN_37, PLAN_38, PLAN_39, PLAN_40, PLAN_41, PLAN_42, PLAN_43, PLAN_44
Stuck Rule: STUCK if PLAN_26 becomes STUCK without an alternative decomposition route.

## Dependency Map

- Primary elimination path PLAN_34/37/40/41 is complete.
- Next queue handoff is PLAN_44 then PLAN_43.
- Legacy `molecule_h_*` elimination path (PLAN_11/15/17/21/24) is complete.

## Current Notes

- `check_axioms` for `Molecule.molecule_conjecture_refined` currently reports:
  - `Molecule.molecule_h_norm`
- The previous placeholder `PseudoSiegelAPrioriBounds := True` has been replaced by
  `PseudoSiegelAPrioriBoundsStatement`, and bounds/canonical extraction now consume
  this stronger contract.
- `molecule_residual_bounds` has been rewired to a seed-free source path
  (`molecule_residual_bounds_seed_free`) that no longer uses `molecule_h_data`.
- New obstruction theorem in `Molecule/Conjecture.lean`:
  `has_invariant_slice_data_forces_univ_finite`, exposing the current
  constant-chart/finiteness mismatch that blocks constructive `h_exists`.
- `PLAN_44` has started with refined chart scaffolding in `Molecule/BanachSlice.lean`
  (`slice_chart_refined`, `refined_singleton_slice_witness`), and a new
  chart-parameterized package in `Molecule/Conjecture.lean`
  (`HasInvariantSliceDataWith`, `has_invariant_slice_data_with_refined`,
  `has_invariant_slice_data_with_refined_default`,
  `InvariantSliceDataWithNormalizationWith`,
  `invariant_slice_data_with_normalization_with_refined_of_local`), plus
  global-to-local normalization bridges
  (`normalization_at_point_of_global`,
  `fixed_point_normalization_data_of_fixed_exists_and_global_norm`) and a
  narrowed bounds interface
  (`problem_4_3_bounds_established_conjecture_from_fixed_exists_and_global_norm`,
  `molecule_residual_fixed_exists`, `problem_4_3_bounds_established_conjecture_from_local_fixed_norm`).
  `molecule_residual_fixed_exists` is now routed through
  `renormalizable_fixed_exists_of_global_norm` (no dependency on
  `molecule_h_exists` / `molecule_h_conj` / `molecule_h_unique`).
- No active STUCK plans in `plan/*.md` this pass.

## Current Critical Blockers

1. Root blocker: `Molecule.molecule_h_norm` remains in the zero-arg theorem path.
2. Active mitigation: PLAN_42 contract hardening and constructive witness rebuild.
